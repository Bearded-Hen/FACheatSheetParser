# FACheatSheetParser
A simple Python script that parses the [FontAwesome Cheatsheet](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/cheatsheet/). FA codes are mapped against unicode values, allowing more readable code.


# Example Output
```
faMap.put("fa-adjust", "\uf042");
```

This is currently used for [Android Bootstrap](https://github.com/Bearded-Hen/Android-Bootstrap), but should provide an easy starting point for anyone wanting to use FontAwesome in any language.
